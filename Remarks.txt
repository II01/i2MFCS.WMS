XML

1. XML can be processed in two ways - by linq to xml (.Elements(""))
2. By automatic class creation (xsd xxx.xsd /c) and XmlSerialize / XmlReserialize functions. Problem is because some types are duplicated. Should be resolved if this option is to be realized. Currently only ERPCommand,ERPCommandReply is ready.


Model 

1. Destination in order should be correct PlaceID address. Only seven characters are used as wildcard to get all targets.
2. OrderSubOrderID must be unique, because this is out reference
3. Moving Order.CurrentOrder,... is not yet realized
